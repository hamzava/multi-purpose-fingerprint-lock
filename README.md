# Multi-Purpose Fingerprint Lock (Budget-Constrained Group Project)

A prototype access-control system designed to provide **secure, low-cost, and user-friendly** locking solutions for doors, safes, and other objects requiring controlled access.  
This project was developed under strict **budget (£100)** and **time constraints**, highlighting practical engineering trade-offs and teamwork.

## 📖 Overview
Unauthorized access remains a persistent problem in both domestic and commercial settings.  
This project addresses the issue by designing a **fingerprint-based lock** using affordable components, while keeping the solution **multi-purpose and commercially feasible**.  

The prototype demonstrates how biometric authentication can be adapted into a cost-sensitive and scalable design.

## 🎯 Objectives
The project team set out to design a lock that is:
1. **Cheap** – affordable prototype made under £100.  
2. **Multi-purpose** – usable for doors, safes, and other lockable objects.  
3. **Commercially feasible** – potential to scale down costs via wholesale components.  
4. **Easy to use** – simple enrollment and unlocking process.  
5. **Secure** – reliable fingerprint authentication.

## 🛠️ Development Process
1. **Hardware Integration** – Fingerprint sensor and solenoid wired to Arduino via a custom PCB.  
2. **Software Setup** – Libraries installed for fingerprint module and solenoid lock in Arduino IDE.  
3. **Programming** – Arduino coded to store fingerprints and trigger solenoid based on authorized access.  
4. **Testing & Debugging** – Prototype tested repeatedly to ensure consistency and security.  
5. **Enclosure Design** – Custom case built to house the PCB and lock mechanism, simulating a commercial product.

## 📚 Research & Background
- **Theory**: Based on biometric authentication — unique physical characteristics (fingerprints) ensure reliable access control.  
- **Research**: Studied fingerprint recognition algorithms, available sensor types, and related security risks.  
- **Feasibility**: Compared with market products (~£90–£110 retail). Our prototype cost **£72.69 Total**, with scope for significant cost reduction in mass production (bulk components, no repeated R&D).
